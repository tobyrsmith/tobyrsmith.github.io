There are literally tons of books about the Apollo program and the
Moon.  If you want to waste a rainy afternoon wandering through the
Apollo literature head over the forth floor of the Engineering
library, they have several shelves of Apollo and other mission
literature.  Below I have listed my favorite books about Apollo.  Most
of them have extensive bibliographies if you want to explore further.

<br></br>

<h3>Exploring the Moon: The Apollo Expeditions</h3> 
<i>David M. Harland - Springer-Praxis; 2nd edition (January 2008)</i>
- <a href="http://amzn.com/0387746382">Amazon</a>

<br></br>

This is the book that I used to use as a text for this class.  It is a
little light on the science, but it does a very good job of covering
each lunar mission in detail.  Lots of very nice images (many of the
same ones I use in class).  If you want a good summary of what this
class is about, this is a good place to start.  Easy to find used.

<br></br>

<h3>Apollo: The Race to the Moon</h3> 
<i>Murray, C. and Cox, C. B. - New York: Simon and Schuster, 1989.</i>
- <a href="http://amzn.com/0976000806">Amazon</a>

<br></br>

My favorite general Apollo book, and probably the best introduction to
the Apollo missions.  Told mainly from the view point of the people in
mission control and the engineers.  This book actually makes the
engineers' lives sound exciting.  Great accounts of Apollo 8 and 13.
Out of print (yet again).  There is a kindle edition.

<br></br>

<h3>T-Minus: The Race to the Moon</h3> 
<i>Jim Ottaviani - Aladdin, 2009. </i>
- <a href="http://amzn.com/1416949607">Amazon</a>

<br></br>

Yes, a graphic novel!  It is good enough that I had to include it in
this list.  A very nice treatment of the story of the early part of
the space race (from Sputnik to Apollo 11).  As you would expect,
there is a lot of simplification and many characters are composites of
a bunch of real people, but the spirit is certainly correct.  It is
also very scientifically sound.  I also really like the drawing style.


<br></br>

<h3>To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration</h3> 
<i>Wilhelms, D. E. - Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1993.</i>
- <a href="http://amzn.com/0816514437">Amazon</a>

<br></br>

Written by a scientist heavily involved in the Apollo missions and
lunar science in general.  Everything you need to know about what
Apollo taught us about the Moon.  Lots of early history about lunar
science, training the Apollo astronauts, choosing landing sites, and
the role of scientists during the Apollo missions.  The book can get a
little technical at times (mostly in the beginning) but generally is
it worth the effort.  Out of print, but easy to find used online.

<br></br>

<h3>The Lunar Sourcebook: A User's Guide to the Moon</h3> 
<i>edited by Heiken, Vaniman, and French Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991.</i>
- <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_sourcebook/">Online</a>

<br></br>

The Moon's reference book.  If you need to know something about the
Moon, its history, geology, chemistry, or what materials are available
to build a colony it is in this book.  It can get really technical but
if you need to know, this is the book to turn to.  Now available online.

<br></br>

<h3>Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys</h3> 
<i>Collins, M. - New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1974.</i>
- <a href="http://amzn.com/0374531943">Amazon</a>

<br></br>

Written by the Command Module Pilot of Apollo 11.  Easily the best
book written by an astronaut.  The best place to learn what is was
like being an astronaut and going to the Moon.  The book is a bit
dated now but no other first-hand account of space flight has come
close to this one.  Newly reissued.

<br></br>

<h3>National Geographic</h3> 

<br></br>

The ubiquitous yellow bordered magazine found at every used book sale.
National Geographic published nice summaries of most of the Apollo
missions, all with great pictures.

<b>February 1969</b> - Pre-Apollo look at the Moon - lots of great Lunar
Orbiter images.  Also includes a nice fold-out Moon Map.</li>

<b>May 1969</b> - Apollo 8

<b>December 1969</b> - Apollo 11 - A classic, even has a cool record
  you can play.

<b>July 1971</b> - Apollo 14

<b>February 1972</b> - Apollo 15

<b>December 1972</b> - Apollo 16

<b>September 1973</b> - Apollo 17
