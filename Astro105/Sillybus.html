<B> Why?</B>: The motivation for this class is pretty simple.  For an
astonishingly short period, a long time ago (July 1969 to December
1972) humans walked on another world. <i>Why did we do this, what did
we learn, and why do we want to go back?</i>

<p>

<B> Prerequisites</B>: This class is designed to be an extension to
the topics that are covered in Astronomy 150 (and to a much lesser
extent, Astronomy 101).  Astronomy 150 is not a prerequisite, but it
would help.  A strong interest in space can certainly make up for the
missing Astro 150.  There will be a little math in the class, but
nothing beyond simple algebra.

<p>

<B>Class Mailing List </B>: I will be using the class mailing list
during class.  Please make sure to monitor your <tt>
u.washington.edu </tt> email account or set it to forward email to the
account you usually read.

<p>

<b> Grading</b>: The current plan is that there will be weekly on-line
lecture quizzes, four short (about 15-20 minutes) exams, a few
homeworks, and one short (~ 2 pages) paper during the quarter. The
preliminary dates for the short exams are given below.  Please note
they may change, but I will give you at least a weeks warning if I am
going to change a quiz date.

<p>

<b> Weekly Online Quizzes </b>: Every week there will be a required
online quiz that is based on that weeks lectures. The quizzes will be of
the short (~ 15 questions) multiple choice variety. The quiz will
be available starting on Friday after lecture (12:00pm) and will only be
available until the follow Tuesday (12:00 pm). These quizzes are a
required part of your grade. Missing a quiz will result in a zero for
that quiz, no exceptions.
