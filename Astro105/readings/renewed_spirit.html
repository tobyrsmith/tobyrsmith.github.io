A RENEWED SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY

The President's Vision for U.S. Space Exploration

President George W. Bush

January 2004

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Background

From the Apollo landings on the Moon, to robotic surveys of the Sun
and the planets, to the compelling images captured by advanced space
telescopes, U.S. achievements in space have revolutionized humanity s
view of the universe and have inspired Americans and people around the
world. These achievements also have led to the development of
technologies that have widespread applications to address problems on
Earth. As the world enters the second century of powered flight, it is
time to articulate a new vision that will define and guide U.S. space
exploration activities for the next several decades.

Today, humanity has the potential to seek answers to the most
fundamental questions posed about the existence of life beyond
Earth. Telescopes have found planets around other stars. Robotic
probes have identified potential resources on the Moon, and evidence
of water -- a key ingredient for life -- has been found on Mars and
the moons of Jupiter.

Direct human experience in space has fundamentally altered our
perspective of humanity and our place in the universe. Humans have the
ability to respond to the unexpected developments inherent in space
travel and possess unique skills that enhance discoveries. Just as
Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo challenged a generation of Americans, a
renewed U.S. space exploration program with a significant human
component can inspire us -- and our youth -- to greater achievements
on Earth and in space.

The loss of Space Shuttles Challenger and Columbia and their crews are
a stark reminder of the inherent risks of space flight and the
severity of the challenges posed by space exploration. In preparation
for future human exploration, we must advance our ability to live and
work safely in space and, at the same time, develop the technologies
to extend humanity s reach to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The new
technologies required for further space exploration also will improve
the Nation s other space activities and may provide applications that
could be used to address problems on Earth.

Like the explorers of the past and the pioneers of flight in the last
century, we cannot today identify all that we will gain from space
exploration; we are confident, nonetheless, that the eventual return
will be great. Like their efforts, the success of future U.S. space
exploration will unfold over generations.

Goal and Objectives

The fundamental goal of this vision is to advance U.S. scientific,
security, and economic interests through a robust space exploration
program. In support of this goal, the United States will:

* Implement a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to
  explore the solar system and beyond;

* Extend human presence across the solar system, starting with a human
  return to the Moon before the year 2020, in preparation for human
  exploration of Mars and other destinations;

* Develop the innovative technologies, knowledge, and infrastructures
  both to explore and to support decisions about the destinations for
  human exploration; and

* Promote international and commercial participation in exploration to
  further U.S. scientific, security, and economic interests.

Bringing the Vision to Reality

The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
will be responsible for the plans, programs, and activities required
to implement this vision, in coordination with other agencies, as
deemed appropriate. The Administrator will plan and implement an
integrated, long-term robotic and human exploration program structured
with measurable milestones and executed on the basis of available
resources, accumulated experience, and technology readiness.

To implement this vision, the Administrator will conduct the following
activities and take other actions as required:

A. Exploration Activities in Low Earth Orbit

Space Shuttle

* Return the Space Shuttle to flight as soon as practical, based on
  the recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation

* Focus use of the Space Shuttle to complete assembly of the
  International Space Station; and

* Retire the Space Shuttle as soon as assembly of the International
  Space Station is completed, planned for the end of this decade;

International Space Station

* Complete assembly of the International Space Station, including the
  U.S. components that support U.S. space exploration goals and those
  provided by foreign partners, planned for the end of this decade;

* Focus U.S. research and use of the International Space Station on
  supporting space exploration goals, with emphasis on understanding
  how the space environment affects astronaut health and capabilities
  and developing countermeasures; and

* Conduct International Space Station activities in a manner
  consistent with U.S. obligations contained in the agreements between
  the United States and other partners in the International Space
  Station.

B. Space Exploration Beyond Low Earth Orbit

The Moon

* Undertake lunar exploration activities to enable sustained human and
  robotic exploration of Mars and more distant destinations in the
  solar system;

* Starting no later than 2008, initiate a series of robotic missions
  to the Moon to prepare for and support future human exploration
  activities;

* Conduct the first extended human expedition to the lunar surface as
  early as 2015, but no later than the year 2020; and

* Use lunar exploration activities to further science, and to develop
  and test new approaches, technologies, and systems, including use of
  lunar and other space resources, to support sustained human space
  exploration to Mars and other destinations.

Mars and Other Destinations

* Conduct robotic exploration of Mars to search for evidence of life,
  to understand the history of the solar system, and to prepare for
  future human exploration;

* Conduct robotic exploration across the solar system for scientific
  purposes and to support human exploration. In particular, explore
  Jupiter s moons, asteroids and other bodies to search for evidence
  of life, to understand the history of the solar system, and to
  search for resources;

* Conduct advanced telescope searches for Earth-like planets and
  habitable environments around other stars;

* Develop and demonstrate power generation, propulsion, life support,
  and other key capabilities required to support more distant, more
  capable, and/or longer duration human and robotic exploration of
  Mars and other destinations; and

* Conduct human expeditions to Mars after acquiring adequate knowledge
  about the planet using robotic missions and after successfully
  demonstrating sustained human exploration missions to the Moon.

C. Space Transportation Capabilities Supporting Exploration

* Develop a new crew exploration vehicle to provide crew
  transportation for missions beyond low Earth orbit;

** Conduct the initial test flight before the end of this decade in
   order to provide an operational capability to support human
   exploration missions no later than

* Separate to the maximum practical extent crew from cargo
  transportation to the International Space Station and for launching
  exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit;

** Acquire cargo transportation as soon as practical and affordable to
   support missions to and from the International Space Station; and

** Acquire crew transportation to and from the International Space
   Station, as required, after the Space Shuttle is retired from
   service.

D. International and Commercial Participation

* Pursue opportunities for international participation to support
  U.S. space exploration goals; and

* Pursue commercial opportunities for providing transportation and
  other services supporting the International Space Station and
  exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit.
