<h1>Astro 150 Grading </h1>

<p>&nbsp</p>

Your grade in Astronomy 150 is based on your results for the two
in-class exams, the weekly on-line quizzes, and labs done in sections.
The distribution of the grade is as follows:

<ul>
 <li> Section Labs - 30%</li>
 <li> On-line quizzes - 20%</li>
 <li> Exam 1 - 25%</li>
 <li> Exam 2 - 25%</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp</p>

<h3>The Details</h3>

<p>&nbsp</p>

Like all classes at UW, this class is graded on a 4.0 scale. For each of
the 4 types of work you do in this class, a grade is assigned on the 4.0
scale. 

<p>&nbsp</p>

<h4>Exams</h4>

<p>&nbsp</p>

Each of the two exams are graded separately. The formula for converting
your exam score to the 4.0 scale (the curve) will be given to you by
your TA afer the exam has been graded and handed back.

The formula for the exam curves is usually an equation of the form:

<pre>

                       (Exam Score - Average)
  Exam Grade = 2.8 +  ------------------------  
                                 Std

</pre>

Where the Average is the exam average score, and Std is the standard deviation of the exam.

<p>&nbsp</p>

<h4>Labs and On-line quizzes</h4>

<p>&nbsp</p>

The grades for your section labs and on-line quizzes is based on the
percentage of the total points you have received. You can estimate your
grade from the table below. 

<p>&nbsp</p>


<table>
	<tr>
		<th>%</th>
		<th>Grade</th>
		<th>%</th>
		<th>Grade</th>
	</tr>	
        <tbody>	
        <tr>
		<td>95</td>
		<td>4.0</td>
		<td>70</td>
		<td>2.2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>90</td>
		<td>3.6</td>
		<td>65</td>
		<td>1.8</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>85</td>
		<td>3.3</td>
		<td>60</td>
		<td>1.4&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>80</td>
		<td>2.9</td>
		<td>55</td>
		<td>1.1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>75</td>
		<td>2.5</td>
		<td>50</td>
		<td>0.7</td>
	</tr>
	<tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp</p>

Scores greater then 95% are set to a 4.0. As you can see, you need to
get at least 50% of the points in the labs and on-line quizzes to get
any grade point for these assignments.

<p>&nbsp</p>

<h4>Final Class Grade</h4>

<p>&nbsp</p>

Your final class grade can be calculated from the grades you received on
each of pieces:

<p>&nbsp</p>

<pre>

    Class Grade = 0.25 * (Exam 1 grade) + 0.25 * (Exam 2 grade)
                + 0.3 * (Section lab grade) + 0.2 * (On-line quiz grade)

</pre>
