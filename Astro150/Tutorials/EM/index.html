<div id="SubTitle">
The Electromagnetic Spectrum
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<p>

The light that ours eyes are sensitive to is but a very small part of
the light that permeates our universe.  The entire range of light is
referred to as
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum">
electromagnetic spectrum</a>.  The diagram below show the range of the
electromagnetic spectrum.  

</p>

<p>

In this class we are going to characterize
light by
its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength">wavelength</a>.
In the diagram below, the electromagnetic spectrum is arranged so that
light with short wavelengths are to the left, and long wavelengths to
the right.

</p>

<p>

As you can see, the part of the spectrum we can see is call <b>visible
light</b>.  We have all seem that when while light passes through a
prism, it is separated into the various colors that make up the
visible part of the spectrum. Each of these colors correspond to a
specific wavelength of light. In this class we measure the wavelength
of light in <b>nanometers (nm)</b>. One nm is equal to one billionth of a
meter. The human eye is sensitive to light in the range of 380 to 750
nm.

<p>

<p> 

Our eyes can not see light that falls outside the visible part of the
spectrum.  However, we can make instruments that can detect and
measure this radiation.  This is very useful, since a lot happens in
our solar system outside of the visible part of the spectrum.

</p>

</div>


<div id="SubTitle">
The Sun
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<div id="FigBox" class="right">

</div>

<p>

The plot on the right shows all of the light that is produced by our
Sun.  The blue line is called the solar spectra.  As you can see, the
highest point of the solar spectra is in the visible part of the
spectrum.  In fact the peak occurs at a wavelength of about 600 nm,
which corresponds to the yellowish part of the visible spectrum.
This is the reason the Sun looks yellowish in the sky.

</p>

<p>

However, you can see that the Sun also produces a lot of light that
falls outside the visible part of the spectrum.  As a matter of fact,
49% of the Sun's energy comes out in
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared">infrared</a> part
of the spectrum. A little (about 5%) comes out in
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>
part of the spectrum, leaving about 46% of the energy pouring out in
the visible part.

</p>

<p>

What this means is that there is a lot of infrared and visible light
coursing through our solar system, interacting with all of the
worlds.  It is this type of light we will be talking about mostly in
this class.

</div>


<div id="SubTitle">
Earth's Atmosphere
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<p>

While all the worlds interact with the same spectra of light from the
Sun, each world interacts with it differently.  Far example, while the
entire range of radiation from the Sun hits the top of the Earth's
atmosphere, not all of that radiation makes it to the surface.  The
characteristic of an atmosphere that describes which wavelengths of
light get thought and which are block, is called the <b>atmospheric
transparency</b>.

</p>

<p>

The atmospheric transparency of the Earth's atmosphere is shown in the
plots below.  As you can see, the Earth's atmosphere let in most of
the visible part of the spectra (no surprise).  We say that the
Earth's atmosphere is transparent in the visible.  However, the
atmosphere blocks most of the ultraviolet and infrared parts of the
spectrum.  The Earth's atmosphere is <b>opaque</b> in the ultraviolet
and infrared.

</p>


<p>

One practical aspect of this is that telescopes that are sensitive in
the ultraviolet are useless on the surface of the Earth.  The sky
would appear blank.  Ultraviolet telescopes are only useful above the
Earth's atmosphere.  There is a similar story in the infrared.
However, as you can see, there are a few ranges of wavelengths in the
infrared part of the spectrum that do make it to the ground.  These
so-called infrared windows are used all of the time by astronomers.
Getting above most of the atmosphere by going to mountain tops, help
a lot to.

</p>

</div>

<p>

The plots on the bottom part, show what in our atmosphere is
responsible for blocking the ultraviolet and infrared light (the grey
areas represent part of the spectrum blocked by the gas).  The
ultraviolet is mostly blocked by our ozone layer, while the infrared
is block mostly by water vapor and carbon dioxide.  Both of these
features are very important to life on the surface of the Earth, and
we will be hearing about it a lot in class.
