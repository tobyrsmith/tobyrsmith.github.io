Gravity Tutorial
</div>

<p>

<b>Gravity</b> is one of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction">four
fundamental forces</a> that exist in nature.  While it is the weakest
of the four forces, it is the dominate force over the large distances
in our solar system.  Gravity dictates the orbits of the worlds in our
solar system, constrains their internal structure, determines their
shape, shapes their surfaces and holds-on to their atmospheres.  The
force of gravity is ubiquitous in Astronomy 150, hardly a lecture will
go by without me mentioning it in some form.  This little tutorial is
my simple attempt to introduce gravity and show how we will use it
most often in this class.

The classic way to introduce gravity is to imagine a universe
consisting only of two spherical objects with masses <b>M</b> and
<b>m</b>.  These masses are separated by a distance <b>d</b> (the
distance is measured from the center-of-mass of the spheres).

</p>

<p>

These two spheres are attracted to each other by the force of gravity.
The force of gravity is always attractive (there is no anti-gravity).
The force of gravity between two objects (<b>M</b>) and (<b>m</b>)
depends of their respective mass and on the inverse of
the <b>square</b> of the distance (<b>d</b>) between them.  The force
is very strongly dependent on the distance between the objects.  This
strong dependence on distance will be an important property of gravity
in Astronomy 150.

The Formula
</div>

<div id="FigBox" class="right">

</div>

<p>

In a more compact form the force of gravity can be expressed by the
formula shown on the right.  The symbol in the middle that looks like
a Greek letter alpha means "proportional to".  This formula can be
expressed in English to read: "The force of gravity if proportional to
the product of the two mass divided by the distance between them
squared".  <b>Learn this equation!</b> It is really the only formula
you will need to know in this class.

</p>
</div>

<div id="FigBox" class="left">

</div>

<p>

The force of gravity can be more correctly expressed by the equation
shown on the left.  The only difference between this equation and the
formula above is that the "proportional to" has been changed to a
"equals to" and a constant <b>G</b> has been added.  This constant
<b>G</b> is called the universal gravitational constant.  <b>G</b> is
just a number (shown on the left), so it does not change the
relationships in the equation.  This is the equation you would use if
you wanted to calculated the force of gravity in newtons (or pounds if
you used a different value of <b>G</b>).  In this class we will mostly
use the simpler formulation for gravity shown above.

An Example - Planets
</div>

<p>

While we will have occasion to talk about two masses separated by a
distance in this class, the format we will most often encounter
gravity is show in the figure on the right.  A person of mass <b>m</b>
is standing on a planet of mass <b>M</b>.  The person is standing a
distance <b>d</b> from the center of the planet.  Most often this
distance will be the <i>radius</i> of the planet.

</p>

<p>

You can then calculate the force of gravity between the planet and the
person.  This calculation is very familiar to us.  The force of
gravity between you and Earth is called your weight.  When you step on
the bathroom scale you are measuring the force of gravity between you
and Earth.

</p>
</div>

<div id="textbox" class="clear">

<p>

One interesting consequence of this is that your weight on the Earth
depends on the mass of the Earth and the distance between you and the
center of the Earth.  For example, imagine that you doubled the size
of the Earth but keep the mass of the Earth the same (see the figure
below).  How would your weight change?  Well you can determine that by
using the formulation shown above and a little algebra.

</p>


<div id="FigBox" class="center">
<img src="./images/GravityBigP.jpg">
</div>


<p>

As you can see, increasing your distance from the center of the Earth,
decreases your weight.  In this case of doubling the Earth's radius,
your weight would <b>decrease</b> by a factor of four.  For example, a
200 pound person on the normal Earth would weigh 50 pounds on the
resized Earth.  As an exercise, you should plug other numbers into the
gravity equation (especially fractions!) and see how your weight would
change.
