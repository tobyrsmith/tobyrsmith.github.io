<h1>Some old midterm gravity problems</b>

<p>

<b>1.</b> If you were to triple the size of the Earth (increase its radius
by a factor of three) and triple the mass of the Earth, how much
would it change the gravity on the Earth (how much would your weight
change)? 

<p>

<b>2.</b> If you were to half the size of the Earth (shrink its radius by
a factor of two) and double the mass of the Earth, how much
would it change the gravity on the Earth (how much would your weight
change)?

<p>

<b>3.</b> You have discovered a planet, that is one half the radius of the
Earth and one half as massive.  How does the gravity on the surface of
the planet compare to the Earth? 

<p>

<b>4.</b> You have discovered a planet that is twice the radius of the
Moon and four times as massive.  How does the gravity on the surface
of this planet compare to the Moon? 

<p>

<b>5.</b> The gravity of the Moon is about 1/6 that of the Earth.  For
example, an astronaut weighing 180 pounds on the Earth would weigh
about 30 pounds on the Moon.  If you were to double the distance
between the Earth and the Moon, how much would our 180 pound astronaut
weigh on the Moon? [Be sure to explain your answer]
