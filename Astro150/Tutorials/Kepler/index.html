<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler"> Johannes
Kepler</a>'s (1571-1630) was a rather strange figure in the history of
astronomy.  Kepler was not really an observer, rather he was a
mathematician.  His analysis of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe">Tycho
Brahe's</a> observational data of the position of Mars, lead to one of
the most important discoveries in astronomy.  Kepler found that the
orbit of Mars (as well as all of the planets in the solar system)
followed three relations.  These relations are now known as
<b>Kepler's three laws of planetary motion</b>.  When Kepler developed
his Laws of planetary motion he did not know the underlying physical
reason why the planets behaved in this manner.  His laws were purely
empirical relationships.  We now know that Kepler's laws are the
consequence of bodies moving under the influence
of <a href="../Gravity/"> gravity</a>.  This means that Kepler's laws
are universal.  They not only describe the motion of the planets, but
of satellites, comets, asteroids, stars and even galaxies.

</p>

<p>

<b>Kepler's laws apply to any object, orbiting another object,
under the influence of gravity</b>.

<b>I. The orbit of a planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at
one focus</b>.  

</p>

<p>

The image on the right shows the elliptical orbit of a planet (blue)
around the Sun (yellow), with the Sun at one of the foci of the
ellipse.  Actually, it is the center of mass of the Solar system that
is at one focus.  The center of mass of our Solar system is near the
surface of the Sun, so saying the Sun is at one focus is not to far
off.  In general, Kepler's first law states that the orbit of one
object around another is an ellipse with the center of mass of the
system at one focus.

</p>


<p>

An elliptical orbit is characterized by two parameters (see the figure
below).  The first parameter is called the <b>semi-major axis</b> and
is represented by the letter <b>a</b>.  The semi-major axis is a
measure of the <i>size</i> of the orbit, the larger the semi-major
axis the larger the orbit.  For an elliptical orbit, the semi-major
axis is also the average distance of the object (planet) from the
focus (Sun).  I will often refer to the average distance of an
orbit. - this is really just the semi-major axis.

</p>

<p>

The semi-major axis of the Earth's orbit around the Sun is
149,597,887.5 km (about 93 million miles).  This distance is called
an <b>Astronomical Unit</b> and is represented by <b>AU</b>.  This
will be the most common unit of distance in this class.  The Earth is
1 AU from the Sun.  Mars is 1.52 AUs from the Sun, or about 1.5 times
farther away.

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="center">
<img src="./images/EllipOrbit_Web.jpg">
</div>


<p>

The second parameter that characterizes an elliptical orbit is called
the <b>eccentricity</b> and is represented by the letter <b>e</b>.
The value for <b>e</b> ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.  The eccentricity is a
measure of the <i>shape</i> of the orbit.  The higher the eccentricity
(the closer it is to 1.0) the "flatter" the orbit.

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="left">
<img src="./images/Kepler6.jpg">
</div>

<p>

The figure on the left shows three orbits with the same value
of <b>a</b> but with different values of <b>e</b>.  The green orbit
has e = 0.0, the red orbit e = 0.3, and the blue orbit has e = 0.7.  As you
can see a circular orbit is simply an elliptical orbit with e = 0.0.

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="right">
<img src="./images/SS_Orbits.jpg">
</div>

<p>

In our Solar system the orbits of most the planets are nearly
circular.  A circle is just a special case on an ellipse.  The figure
on the right shows the orbits of the 4 inner worlds Mercury, Venus,
Earth and Mars.  As you can see, their orbits are very close to
circular.  There are objects in our solar system (i.e. comets) with
very elliptical orbits.

<div id="SubTitle">
Kepler's Second Law
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<div id="FigBox" class="right">

<p>

The speed of a planet in orbit around the Sun is not constant.  The
planet's speed continually varies as it moves along its elliptical
orbit.  The planet moves fastest when it is closest to the Sun [called
perihelion] and slowest when furthest away [called aphelion].

</p>

<p>

A more precise way of defining the planet's changing speed is to
imagine a line connecting the planet with the Sun.  Kepler's second
law then states:

</p>

<p>
<b>Kepler's Second Law</b>
</p>

<p>

<b>II. A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in
equal intervals of time </b>.

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="left">
<img src="./images/Kepler3.jpg">
</div>

<p>

In this figure is takes the same amount of time for the planet to
sweep out the blue area as it does to sweep out the pink area.
Kepler's second law states then that the area of the blue wedge is the
same as the pink wedge.  Of course you can take any two equal time
intervals (not just around aphelion and perihelion as I have shown
here) and the areas swept out will be equal.

</p>

<p>

In a circular orbit (e = 0.0) the speed of the planet is constant
since the distance from the focus is always the same.  In a very
elliptical orbit (e close to 1.0) the speed of the planets changes a
lot.  It is very fast close to the focus, and very slow far away.

</p>

<div id="SubTitle">
Kepler's Third Law
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<div id="FigBox" class="right">
<img src="./images/SS_Orbits.jpg">
</div>

<p>

Not only is the speed of a planet in orbit around the Sun not
constant, the times it takes to make one orbit of the Sun (called its
<b>Period</b>) depends on the <b>average distance</b> from the Sun to
the planet.  Planets that are further from the Sun take longer to
orbit than planets that are closer to the Sun (<i>i.e.</i> Mars has a
period of 1.6 years while the Earth has a period of 1 year).

</p>

<p>

The relationship between a planet's period and its average distance is
given by Kepler's third law:

</p>

<p>
<b>Kepler's Third Law</b>
</p>

<p>

<b>III. The squares of the periods of the planets are proportional to the
cubes of their semi-major axis (average distance)</b>.

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="center">
<img src="./images/KeplerEq0.jpg">
</div>


<p> 

What this boils down to is that the larger the semi-major axis of an
orbit, the longer it takes the planet to orbit the Sun.

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="right">
<img src="./images/Kepler6.jpg">
</div>

<p>

A little more need to be said about the average distance business.
The figure on the right shows three orbits.  All three of these orbits
have the same average distance.  However, since a planet moves in an
elliptical orbit its distance from the Sun can be constantly changing.
This means that even thought two object have the same average distance
they may have very different distances at any one particular moment
in time.  For example, Halley's comet has a period of about 76 years.
Kepler's third law would tell us that Halley's comet has an average
distance much greater than that of the Earth.  However, there is a
time in Halley's comet's orbit that brings it closer to the Sun than
the Earth.

A Little Math
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<p>

Kepler's third law is a mathematical relation between a planet's
period and its average distance.  With a little simple algebra we can
determine one of the values if we are given the other.  First of all
it helps to rearrange the relationship slightly and apply a little
cleverness:

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="left">
<img src="./images/KeplerEq1.jpg">
</div>

<p>

Kepler's third law can be rearranged and turned in to an equality as
is shown on the left.  The <b>Constant</b> is just a number.  However,
it is important to know that this <b>Constant</b> is the same for
anything orbiting the Sun.  The value of this <b>Constant</b> depends
on the units you use to measure the <b>Period</b> and <b>Average
Distance</b>.  Here is where the clever part come in:

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="right">
<img src="./images/KeplerEq2.jpg">
</div>

<p>

If you measure the <b>Period</b> in [years] and the <b>Average
Distance</b> in <i>astronomical units</i> [AU] [an astronomical unit
is defined as the average distance between the Earth and the Sun] then
the <b>Constant</b> equals <b>1</b>.  Why is this?  Well the Earth has
a period of 1 year and an average distance if 1 AU.  Stick these
numbers into the equation above and the <b>Constant</b> equals 1.
Now, since this constant is the same for everything orbiting the Sun,
as long as you measure the period in years and the average distance in
AUs then the <b>Constant</b> is always 1.

</p>

</div>


<div id="SubTitle">
An Example
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<p>

<b>Determine the period of an object that orbits the Sun at an average
distance of 4 AU.</b>

</p>

<p>

Plug the average distance into the equation above, do a little
algebra:

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="center">
<img src="./images/KeplerEq3.jpg">
</div>

<p>

And voila! An object with an average distance of 4 AU takes 8 years to
go around the Sun.  Easy as can be.  Of course not all (or many)
problems have such nice integer answers, but that is why calculators
were invented.

</p>

This little tutorial is a very qualitative discussion of Kepler's
Laws.  If you want to dive into all of the fun mathematics of Kepler's
Laws,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion">
Wikipedia entry</a> is a pretty good place to start.
