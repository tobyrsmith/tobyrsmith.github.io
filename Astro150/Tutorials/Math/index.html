Math and Graph Tutorial
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<p>
This is a very simple math and graph tutorial for those of you who have
not seen math in a while.  It is by no means complete, but it hits the
highlights of the concepts I use all of the time in class.
</p>

Fractions
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<p>

A little terminology: the number on the top of a fraction is called the
<b> numerator </b> while the number on the bottom is called the <b>
denominator </b>.  For example, in the fraction 2/3, 2 is the numerator
and 3 is the denominator.  Of course in formulas, the numerators and
denominators can be quite a bit more complicated.  The <b>reciprocal</b>
of a fraction is simply the fraction turned upside down.  The reciprocal
of 2/3 is 3/2.

</p>

</div>

<p>

The place where people seems to have the most problems with fractions in
this class is the case were the denominator is itself a fraction.
Simplifying this type of problem is easy: just multiply the numerator by
the reciprocal of the denominator.

</p>

<p>

In the first example on the right, the numerator is 1 and the
denominator is 1/2.  The reciprocal of the denominator (1/2) is equal to
(2/1), so the problem simplifies to 1 times 2 which equals 2.

</p>

<p>

In the second example, both the numerator and the denominator are
fractions, but the process is exactly the same.  Make sure you can do
simple examples like this in your sleep.

Powers
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<div id="FigBox" class="right">
<img src="./images/Pow0.jpg">
</div>


<p>

Powers, or exponents, occur a lot in this class.  Particularly when we
are talking about <a href="../Gravity/">gravity</a>.  Exponents are
simply the number of times an expression get multiplied by itself.  This
expression can be a formula, a variable, a number, a fraction, etc.  For
example on the right is an example of the exponentiation of a  number
and a fraction.

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="left">
<img src="./images/Pow4.jpg">
</div>

<p>

Now you can combine the fractions above with exponentiation to
manipulate fraction taken to various powers.  The example on the left
shows an example of this.  Make sure you understand this example, as you
will be asked to do something very similar to it on the midterm.

</p>


<p>

A special case of exponents that occurs all of the time in this class
with when the number 10 is taken to various powers.  This is used when
numbers get so large that writing out all of the zeros becomes a pain.
For example the expression 10<sup>6</sup> is just 10 multiplied by
itself 6 times.  This expression is equal to million (1,000,000) and is
much easier to write than all of the zeros.  In this class we will use
the number a billion (10<sup>9</sup>) a lot.  Writing 10<sup>9</sup> is
much easier than 1,000,000,000 and saves you from having to count all of
the zeroes to see that the number is actually a billion.

</p>


<p>

Taking 10 to various powers leads naturally to the discussion of <i>
scientific notation</i>.  Scientific notation is simply a shorthand way
of expressing very large numbers.  And since there are lots of very large
numbers in this class, there will be lots of scientific notation.  An
example of scientific notation if given below.  See how using powers of
10, make the large number much easier to write and read.

</p>

<img src="./images/Pow1.jpg">
</div>

<p> 

<b>N.B.</b> In very rare cases in this class scientific notation will be
notated with an "e" instead of a power of 10.  For example the number
1.63 * 10<sup>6</sup> may be written as 1.63e6.

Symbols

<p>

Finally, a few words on a few of the mathematical symbols you will see
often in this class.  On the right are three expression for the value of
the density of Iron.  The first expression is the exact equality (=).
It should be read: "The density of Iron is equal to 7.9
g/cm<sup>3</sup>." The other two expression are what I use for
approximate values.  Both of these expression should be read: "The
density if Iron is approximately equal to 8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>."  The last
symbol (~) is not really the correct expression for "approximately equal
to" but I use it as such, so there.

<p>

On the left are two expression for the <i>kinetic energy</i> of an
object.  The first expression is the exact equality.  It should be read:
"The kinetic energy (K.E.) is equal to the mass (m) times the velocity
(v) squared.  In the second expression, the symbol that looks like the
Greek letter alpha is the symbol for "proportional to".  This expression
should be read: "The kinetic energy (K.E.) is proportional to the
velocity (v) squared.  I use this when I am pointing out some important
aspect of a formula.  For example, that the kinetic energy depends
strongly on the velocity of an object.

Graphs
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<div id="FigBox" class="right">
<img src="./images/Graph0.jpg">
</div>

<p>

A graph is a chart or drawing that shows the relationship between
changing things.  They are a diagram displaying the relationship between
numbers or amounts. Common graphs use bars, lines, points or parts of a
circle to display data.  Nearly all of the graphs I use in this class
are the classic 2-dimensional X-Y plots.  I will almost always refer to
the horizontal axis as the X-axis and the vertical axis as the Y-axis
(see plot on right).

</p>

<p>

The axes actually have proper names; the <i>ordinate</i> for the X-axis
and the <i>abscissa</i> for the Y-axis.  However, I never remember those
names so I will not use them.

</p>
</div>


<div id="textbox">

<p>

The two main axes types I use in this class are <b> linear </b> and <b>
logarithmic </b>.  Often times I will not mention the types of axes
displayed, so pay attention.  

</p>

<p>

A <b> linear </b> graph has values that change as you would expect.  In
the example below one point 5 units farther down the X-axis has a value
that is 5 units larger.

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="center">
<img src="./images/Graph1.jpg">
</div>

<p>

A <b> logarithmic </b> graph is more complicated.  Generally, the major
division on the graph differ by a power of 10.  For example on the
X-axis below the two points are two major divisions away, but their
values differ by a factor of 100 = (10<sup>2</sup>).

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="center">
<img src="./images/Graph2.jpg">
</div>

<p>

<b>N.B.</b> Many graphs have one axis linear and the other logarithmic.
These types of graphs are often referred to as semi-logarithmic.
