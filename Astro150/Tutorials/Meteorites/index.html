Meteorites are fragments of other worlds that have survived the entry
into the Earth's atmosphere.  Most meteorites originate in the
asteroid belt from bodies that formed very early in the history of the
solar system.  Almost all of the information we have learned about the
solar system, such as its age, history, and chemical composition, is
due to the detailed study of meteorites.  From the point of view of
origin, there are three basic types of meteorites: <b>Stony</b>,
<b>Stony-Iron</b>, and <b>Iron</b>.  In this exercise I have broken
down the Stony class into three sub-classes: <b>Carbonaceous
Chondrites</b>, <b>Ordinary Chondrites</b>, and <b>Achondrites</b>.
Meteoriticists recognize many more classes of meteorites and have
reconstructed a marvelously detailed history of the solar system from
their subtle differences.

Carbonaceous Chondrite Meteorites

</div>

<p>

An especially important type of meteorite is the carbonaceous
chondrite, a specific type of stony meteorite that originates from
<b>primitive</b> asteroids. In this context, <b>primitive</b> means
that the asteroid has been altered very little over the age of the
solar system.  More specifically, it means that the asteroid has not
been heated to the point that would change the material that makes up
the asteroid.

</p>

<p>

Carbonaceous Chondrite Meteorites are black to dark gray in color,
rich in the element carbon (thus their black color), and contain small
spherical droplet-like inclusions called chondrules.  They are among
the most primitive objects in the solar system, having survived almost
unchanged for 4.6 billion years.  Carbonaceous chondrites were the
first place amino acids were found outside of the Earth, and it has
been recently learned that some of the materials in these meteorites
were formed outside of our solar system before our solar system was
even formed, so they are not only an important probe into our early
solar system history, but they may supply us with samples of materials
from beyond our solar system.

</p>

<p>

Carbonaceous chondrites are rare among meteorites that fall to the
Earth (~ 4%).  Added to the fact that they look enough like Earth
rocks, means that they are very rare in collections.  They also
weather very easily and do not survive long on the surface of the
Earth.  [This image shows a slice of a type of carbonaceous chondrite
meteorite that fell to the Earth in Allende, Mexico, on February 9,
1969.]

<div id="SubTitle">
Ordinary Chondrites
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<div id="FigBox" class="left">

</div>

<p>

Ordinary chondrites are the most common meteorites that fall to Earth
(~ 74%).  Since they tend to have a similar appearance and density as
Earth rocks, stony meteorites are difficult to recognize in the field.
Unless someone sees them fall, they usually go uncollected.
Therefore, although ordinary chondrites are the most common type out
in space, they are more rare than iron meteorites in collections on
Earth. 

</p>

<p>

Ordinary chondrites show a wide variety of appearances: some light,
some dark, some coarse grained, some fine--grained.  As their name
implies, ordinary chondrites contain chondrules.  However, the
chondrules in ordinary chondrites are never as distinct as the ones in
carbonaceous chondrites.  This is a nice indication that ordinary
chondrites have been heated to a higher temperature than carbonaceous
chondrites, and are therefore less primitive.  Almost all ordinary
chondrites contain some metallic iron, you can see the iron as bright
metallic flakes throughout the sample.  Since the rock and iron are
well mixed, this implies that the object that the ordinary chondrite
came from never differentiated.

</p>

<p>

Most ordinary chondrites are from the outer parts of an asteroid that
suffered destruction by collision.  Since ordinary chondrites are the
most common meteorite on the Earth, this implies that they represent
the most common material in the asteroid belt.  Since ordinary
chondrites come from bodies that that not been heated very much, this
means they come from object that were never very large.  This implies
that most of the objects in the asteroid belt were never very large.
[This image shows a slice of an Ordinary chondrite.  This sample fell
to the Earth in Homestead, Iowa on February 12, 1876.]

Achondrites
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<div id="FigBox" class="right">
<a href="./images/AChon_Big.jpg">

</div>

<p>

As their name implies, Achondrites are stony meteorites that lack
chondrites.  Achondrite meteorites account for only about 8% on the
meteorites that hit the Earth.  The lack of chondrules is a sign that
most achondrites meteorites have been subjected to a much greater
degree of heating that other stony meteorites.  This implies the
achondrites came from bodies that have been geologically active in the
past.  Many achondrites are very similar to terrestrial volcanic
material.  Some achondrites are pieces of impact breccia, and some are
very similar to pristine highland rocks on the Moon.

</p>

<p>

In general, achondrites are the materials from the surface (or near
surface) of a once geologically active surface.  All meteorites from
Mars and the Moon are achondrites.  All rocks on the Earth would be
achondrites if they blasted into space and fell back as meteorites.

Stony-Iron Meteorites

</div>

<p>

Stony-Iron meteorites are the rarest class of meteorites, comprising
only about 1% of meteorites that fall to Earth.  There are two broad
classes of stony-iron meteorites: <i>Pallasites</i> (composed
primarily of iron with crystals of a rock mineral called olivine
embedded in it) and <i>mesosiderites</i> (that look like stony
meteorites with lots of metallic iron veins running through them).

</p>

<div id="FigBox" class="right">
<a href="./images/Meso_Big.jpg">
<img src="./images/Meso.jpg"></a>
</div>

<p>

<i>Pallasites</i> are thought to be material from the boundary zone
between the iron cores and the stony outer mantles of the
now-destroyed asteroids, while <i>mesosiderites</i> are theorized to
be formed when an impact on an asteroid mixes material from the rocky
mantle with iron from the core.  The image on the left shows a
polished slice of a <i>pallasite</i> stony-iron meteorite.  The dark
roundish inclusions are the rocky mineral <i>olivine</i>, and the
lighter surrounding material is metallic iron.  This sample is from
the Brenham meteorite crater in Kansas.  The image on the right is
a <i>mesosiderite</i> meteorite from the Dalgaranga meteorite crater
in Western Australia.  The sample has been heavily weathered.  The
grey veins of metallic iron and the brown areas of rock are intimately
mixed.

Iron Meteorites

<p>

Iron meteorites are the most easily recognizable meteorites.  Since
even a casual examination shows that they are not ordinary rocks, they
tend to be very common in collections although they are rare in space
(~5% of all meteorites).  They are very dense and, except for a thin
crust (made by the melting of the skin during the passage through the
atmosphere), they look and feel like metal.  Chemically, they are
composed mostly of iron with a few percent nickel and a little cobalt.

</p>

<p>

When sawed in half, polished, and etched, they display a geometrical
pattern called a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widmanstatten_pattern">
  Widmanstatten </a> pattern (see figure).  This pattern is actually
crystals of iron and nickel that form as the result of the meteorite
having cooled very slowly (about 1 degree C per million years) under
very high pressure.  The existence of the
<b>Widmanstatten</b> pattern is our best evidence that iron meteorites
were once the cores of larger, differentiated bodies.  Buried deep in
a body, the mass of the overlying rocks provide the high pressure and
the insulation for slow cooling.  The image on the left shows a
polished and etched cross--section of an iron meteorite from the
Henbury impact craters in Australia.

<div id="SubTitle">
The Impacted
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<p>

When a large meteorite strikes the Earth, the kinetic energy of the
meteorite is converted into thermal, mechanical, and acoustic energy
that creates a shockwave that passes through the ground and distorts,
fractures, and ejects pieces of the target.  This modified target
material is often all that remains of a crater after millions of years
of geological activity.  Therefore, the recognition of this material
plays an important role in understanding impact events.  The most
common types of impact--modified material we will see are: <b>impact
breccia</b>, <b>shatter cones</b>, and <b>tektites</b>.

</p>

<div id="SubTitle">
Impact Breccia
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<div id="FigBox" class="left">
<a href="./images/Breccia_Big.jpg">
<img src="./images/Breccia.jpg"></a>
</div>

<p>

Impact breccias form when a crater--forming meteorite shatters,
pulverizes, and melts the target material.  They are composed of rock
and mineral fragments embedded in a <b>matrix</b> of fine--grained
material.  The fragments are usually sharp and angular, and vary
greatly in size and shape.  The composition of the fragments depends
on the target material.  Impact breccias often have the appearance of
poorly mixed concrete (see figure).  On airless, impact--covered
worlds like the Moon, impact breccias are a very common type of rock.
The most common type of sample returned by the Apollo lunar mission
was impact breccia.  Unfortunately, rocks that look a lot like impact
breccias can be formed by volcanic and tectonic processes, so finding
a breccia is not always a clear indication of an impact event.  [This
images shows a piece of impact breccia from the Ries crater in
Germany.]

<div id="SubTitle">
Shatter Cones
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<div id="FigBox" class="right">
<a href="./images/ShatterCone_Big.jpg">
<img src="./images/ShatterCone.jpg"></a>
</div>

<p>

Shatter cones form when the shockwave from a meteorite impact event
passes through the target rocks and modifies them.  The resulting
rocks have distinctive, curved, striated fractures that typically form
partial to complete cones [see figure].  Shatter cones can form in all
types of target rocks.  The better--looking shatter cones form in very
fine--grained rocks like sandstones.  They can range in size from
centimeters to many tens of meters.  Shatter cones are now accepted as
a unique identifier of a meteorite impact event.  This means that if
you find a shatter cone, you have found a place where a meteorite has
hit.  Since the Earth is such an dynamic world, it will erase impact
craters over a relatively short time period.  Often, shatter cones are
all that is left to identify an impact crater.  An interesting feature
of shatter cones is that the tips point toward the origin of the
shockwave.  This means that you can use shatter cones to reconstruct
the size and shape of ancient impact craters that have subsequently
been modified by other processes.  [This image shows a shatter cone
from the Steinheim Basin in Germany.]

Tektites
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<div id="FigBox" class="left">
<a href="./images/Tektites_Big.jpg">
<img src="./images/Tektites.jpg"></a>
</div>

<p>

Tektites have been controversial objects since their discovery, with
both their origin and source being a subject of hot debate for more
than a century.  Tektites are small, glassy objects with shapes like
spheres, ellipsoids, dumbbells, and other forms characteristics of
isolated molten blobs.  They are typically black, but can be brown,
gray, or even green.  Tektites look a lot like volcanic glass
(<i>e.g.,</i> obsidian) but are chemically distinct.  The most telling
chemical difference is that unlike volcanic glasses, tektites contain
virtually no water.  Current scientific consensus is that tektites are
terrestrial material that has been melted and ejected from an impact
event.  Their shape is derived from cooling, aerodynamically, during
flight from the impact.  Tektites are fairly common all over the
Earth.  (You can almost always find them for sale in "New Age" crystal
shops.)  However, linking them with particular impact events has
proven problematic.  When exactly the tektites are formed during an
impact event, and why they are found at only a few craters are two of
the more obvious problems that have yet to be satisfactorily solved.
[This image shows a collection of tektites from Thailand.]
