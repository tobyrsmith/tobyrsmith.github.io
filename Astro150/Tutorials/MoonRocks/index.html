The Apollo lunar exploration project was perhaps the single most
ambitious engineering project of the 20th century. Although science
was not the reason Apollo went to the moon, its most lasting legacy may
be that 35 years after the last Apollo left the surface of the Moon,
scientific papers are still being published based on the samples
returned by the six lunar missions.

</p>

<p>

Lunar samples are the only extraterrestrial material brought back from
a specific geographical location by spacecraft (as of 2009).  They
have been of great value in advancing our understanding of the Moon
and the history of our solar system.  An immense amount of scientific
work has been done on them by scientists around the world and the
quantity of information they have provided is staggering.

</p>

<p>

The samples that we will examine were brought back by the astronauts
of the Apollo program.  Lunar samples were also returned by three
Soviet robot probes that landed after Apollo.  The Apollo program
first landed on the Moon in July of 1969 with the landing of Apollo
11; it ended in December of 1972, when Apollo 17 returned to the
Earth.  In this amazingly short time of two-and-a-half years, six
different places on the Moon were explored, thousands of pictures were
taken, and 382 kg of rocks and soil were collected.  A summary of the
missions is printed below.

<b>Mare Basalts</b> - The first lunar samples brought back by Apollo
11 from Mare Tranquillitatis were black volcanic basalts.  The basalts
came from different depths, from the surface down to 100's of meters
deep, spilling out onto the mare surface as very fluid lava, filling
up the large impact basins of the Moon.  They have ages ranging from
3.2 to 3.9 billion years.  They are very similar to terrestrial
basalts except for some minor chemical differences.  Lunar basalts
have fewer iron-like elements and fewer elements with low melting
temperatures (volatiles).

<b>Impact Breccias</b> - Breccias are composite rocks made by the
solidification of a mix of various irregularly sized and shaped pieces
of various rocks.  They were formed by impact events, which first
shattered and then compacted pieces of rock from different places,
melting them together.  Lunar breccias usually consist of grains of
various sizes.  Typical grains are centimeter and millimeter chunks
welded together in a finer-grained matrix.  Lunar breccias can have a
wide variety of ages depending on the rock incorporated within them.
The fact that most of the Apollo samples were breccias demonstrates
how pervasive impacts were throughout lunar history.

<b>Pristine Highland Rocks</b> - As their name implies, pristine
highland rocks are rocks collected mainly in the lunar highlands that
have not been substantially altered by reheating since they were first
formed.  These rocks may represent material from the original lunar
crust that formed between 4.6 and 4.3 billion years ago.  The chemical
composition of these rocks implies the outer layers of the Moon
experienced extensive melting in its early history.  These types of
rocks are very rare in the Apollo collection.  The most famous of
these rocks is the "Genesis Rock" collected by Apollo 15.  In this
class, I will sometimes refer to there type of rocks
as <i>Anorthosite</i>.

<b>Regolith</b> - The lunar regolith is a loose "soil" that covers the
Moon from a depth of a few meters on the mare, to a few tens of meters
on the highlands.  It was created by the continuous, slow, plowing
action of meteoritic bombardment.  The regolith shows a wide range of
particle sizes and compositions.  The main composition reflects the
local underlying rock.  On the mare surfaces, the regolith is basalt
rich, while on the highland surfaces, there is a greater abundance of
pristine highland rocks fragments.  In most samples one can find tiny
glass spherules.  Meteoritic material is also present, but is very
rare.

Thin Sections
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<p>

A thin section is a hair-thin slice of rock, mounted on a microscope
slide.  The rock is ground down to about 30 micrometers thick (1000
micrometer = 1 mm).  What you end up with is a translucent sliver of
stone, thinner than paper.  To the naked eye, a thin section is nearly
transparent, and that's true under the microscope too. Even dark
minerals like garnet or olivine are clear.

</p>

<p>

When these thin--sections are view under a polarizing microscope, the
different minerals take on colors that sometimes are quite vivid.
Basically, those colors tell the observer a lot about a mineral's
identity and composition.  The images that we will look at in this lab
are thin--sections of lunar rocks taken through a microscope, both in
the visible light and with polarizing filters.

What To Look For
</div>

<div id="textbox">


<p>

<b>Mare Basalts</b> - The basalts often show long, thin crystals,
sometimes irregularly shaped.  The sizes of the crystals are a
function of the cooling time.  Fast--cooling lava produces small
crystals, while slow--cooling lava leads to larger crystals.  Small
sized crystals tend to be much more common, suggesting that most of
the basalt cooled rather quickly.  There is often a matrix of
different--sized small crystals.  The crystals often show fracturing.
The grains show a wide range of colors under the polarizing filters
(like a stained glass window).  The various colors correspond to a
variety of minerals.  The most common minerals are pyroxene (yellow),
feldspar (grayish, often with bands), olivine (bright colors), and
sometimes ilmenite (opaque).

<p>

<b>Impact Breccias</b> - Lunar breccia show a large range of particle
sizes, with small grains being the most abundant.  Unlike basalts, the
small grains are usually not distinct crystals. The matrix (the
material between the larger grains) is fine--grained, and sometimes
glassy or black.  Since impact breccia is made up of whatever rock was
on the ground at the time of the impact, you can often see little
pieces of basalt or pristine highland rocks in the breccia.  Often you
see smaller, distinct breccias inside larger breccias.  The colors you
see under the polarizing filters vary depending on what type of rock
the breccia is composed of.

</p>

</div>

<p>

<b>Pristine Highland Rocks</b> - The grains of pristine highland rocks
rocks are usually large (up to 1 cm), coarse, angular, and fractured.
The large grain sizes imply slow cooling and the fractures are due to
shocks caused by impacts.  The grains are mostly composed of low
density materials such as feldspar.  The colors of grains are usually
white to grey-blue under the polarizing filters.  There are far few
colors than you see in basalts.  This is a reflection of the fact
that these rocks are composed mostly of one type of mineral.

</div>

<p>

<b>Regolith</b> - The regolith samples are made up of separate pieces
of millimeter-sized materials.  The particles are distinct, there is
no matrix between the particles like there is in a breccia.  Sometimes
glass spherules or other irregularly-shaped pieces of glass are
visible among the particles.  Look for basalt, breccia, and even
pristine highland fragments.
