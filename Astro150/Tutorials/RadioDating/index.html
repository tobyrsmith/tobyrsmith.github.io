OK, so you got a rock. How do you determine how old it is?

</p>

<p>

One thing that should be made clear from the beginning: The age of a
rock is really just a measure of how long it has been since the rock
cooled to become a rock, not how long the material has been around. If
you take any rock, melt it, and let it cool back to a rock, it will be
a new rock with its age clock reset to zero years old.  You should
keep this in mind when we are talking about determining the age of
rocks.

</p>

<p>

A more relevant example: Let us say that a rock is sitting on the
surface of the Moon. A billion years after that rock was formed, the
rock is covered and remelted by a lava flow. Two billion years after
the lava flow that rock is uncovered by an impact and thrown to the
surface. The rock is then picked up by an astronaut, brought back to
the Earth, and dated. The age determined for that rock will be two
billion years old, NOT three billion years old.

</p>

<p>

Of course things can get more complicated. The impact that uncovered
the rock may have melted part of the rock, reseting the age clock for
a portion of the rock. Of course things can get EVEN more complicated.
Most rocks returned by the Apollo missions are impact breccias. These
are are a mixture of different rock samples that have been "welded"
together by the impact process. Each of the different rock types in
the breccia may have different ages, and the "welding" process itself
may have even reset the age of some part of the rock.  Untangling this
whole mess is what makes the science of determining rock ages fun.

</p>

<p>

In general the ages derived from samples of basalt are more consistent
that the ages derived from impact breccias.  The diagram below shows
the ages for the six Apollo sites are determined from thier samples.
The samples from Apollo 11 and 12 are mostly basalts, so, as you can
see, are ages of those sites is pretty well determined (red).  On the
other hand, the samples from Apollo 14 are pretty much all impact
breccias.  The age of the Apollo 14 site (blue) is much less
constrained that that of Apollo 11 and 12.

Radioactive Decay
</div>

<div id="textbox">

<p>

Geologist determine the age of rock using a technique called
radioactive dating. This technique relies on the fact that some
elements in the rocks spontaneously change into other elements at a
<b>well defined rate</b>. This spontaneous change is called
radioactive decay. Radioactive decay occurs because some elements are
more stable than others, and if nature gives the unstable elements a
path to become more stable, they will take it.

</p> 


<p>

While there are many different elements that geologists use to
determine the ages of rocks, One of the most common elemets used to
determine the age of lunar samples is Rubidium (Rb).

</p>



<p>

Rubidium (Rb) is the 16th most abundant element in the earth's crust,
and is present in many different minerals.  Most of the Rubidium in
rocks (72.17%) is composed of 37 protons and 48 neutrons. This is
called Rubidium-85. It is nice and stable.  However, a fraction of the
Rubidium in rocks (27.83%) is composed of 37 protons and 50 neutrons.
This is called Rubidium-87. Rubidium-87 is not stable and if given the
chance, it would like to change to a stable state.  <i>This change to
a stable state is what we call radioactive decay</i>.  Rubidium-87
changes to a stable state by having one of its neutrons turn into a
proton by kicking out an electron (and an antineutrino) and turning
into Strontium-87.  This process is called beta-decay and can be
written down like this:

<p>

Now the key to this whole process, and why we can use it to determine
the age of rocks, is that the radioactive decay of Rubidium-87 happens
at a <i>very well defined rate</i>.  This well defined rate is called
the <b>half-life</b>. The radioactive decay of a single Rubidium-87
atom will happen at a completely random time (radioactive decay is one
of the few truly random phenomena in nature). That single Rubidium-87
atom has a 50% chance of decaying within a time-span called its
half-life.  Another way to think about this is to say, that for a very
large bunch of Rubidium-87 atoms, 50% will decay within one half-life.

</p>

<p>

<b> The half-life of Rubidium-87 is 47.5 billion years. </b>

</p>

<p>

A simple example (see the diagram below): Let us say that you start
with 1000 Rubidium-87 atoms. 47.5 billion years later about one half
of them will have decayed into Strontium-87.  After one half life you
will have about 500 Rubidium-87 atoms and 500 Strontium-87 atoms.  In
another 47.5 billion years you will have about 250 Rubidium-87 and 750
Strontium-87, and so on.

</p>

<p>

As you can see, after a handful of half-lifes, very little of the
original radioactive material remains.  It is a finite resource.  This
means that is some pratical concern when it comes to determining the
ages of Moon rocks.  Since every measurement has some limit to how
small an amount one can measure, if you want to measure the amount of
radioacitve material in sample, you can not wait for 1000s of half
lifes.

What this really means is that half-life of the element you are trying
to measure sould be of the
same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude">order
of magnitude</a> as the age of the sample.  For example, an element
with a half-life of 1000 years is not a good choice for determining
the age of Moon rocks, since it will have gone through about 3,000,000
half-lifes!  At the other end of the scale, an element with a
half-life of 47.5 billion years, is not a good choice for determining
the age of a young lave flow on the Earth, as very little of the
radioactive material would have decayed.

</p>

<p>

Determining the age of rocks would seem to to be a simple matter of
measuring the amounts of Rubidium-87 and Strontium-87, and since you
know the half-life of Rubidium-87 you can determine the age of the
rock.  Well, nature is never really that nice.  The main problem is is
that we cannot assume that the rock has no Strontium-87 to begin with.

</p>


<p>

To get around this problem, a much more robust method of radioactive
age dating has been developed
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochron_dating">Isochron
Dating</a>.  In this process you determine the abundance of
Rubidium-87 and Strontium-87 in many different minerals in the same
one rock sample.  You also determine the abundance of a stable element
for comparison.  In our example, the comparison element we will use is
Strontium-86, a stable version of Strontium that is not the result of
a radioactive decay.  In practice it is often much easier to measure
the ratio of two elements, rather than one element all alone.  For
rock dating we often measure the ratio of Rubidium-87/Strontium-86 and
the ratio of Strontium-87/Strontium-86.  The actual determination of
the Rubidium and Strontium abundance in a sample in a very non-trivial
tasks, that takes a lot of sophisticated equipment.  It is really an
art.
