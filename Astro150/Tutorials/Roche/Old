The <b>Roche Limit</b> is a useful concept to learn about when trying
to understand the ring systems around the giant planets Saturn, Uranus
and Neptune.  (Jupiter's ring system is strange, we will talk about
that in lecture).  The Roche Limit was first described by the French
mathematician Edouard Albert Roche (1820 - 1883) in 1848.  The
simplest definition of the Roche Limit is that it is <i>the closest
distance a body held together by self-gravity can come to a planet
without being pulled apart by the planet's tidal (gravity) force</i>.
What does this mean?  Read on...

In the <a
href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/smith/Astro150/Gravity/Gravity.html">
Gravity</a> tutorial, we learned about the force of gravity by
imagining a universe consisting only of two spherical objects with
masses <b>M</b> and <b>m</b>.  These masses are separated by a
distance <b>d</b> (the distance is measured from the center-of-mass of
the spheres).

We found that the force of gravity attracting the two sphere together,
can be express by the, now familiar, formula shown on the right.  The
important thing to notice in this tutorial, is that force is very
strongly dependent on the distance between the objects.

Now let us make the problem a little more interesting by placing the
two masses (red and blue) in the vicinity of a very large mass
(yellow).  The red and blue masses are still attracted together by the
force of gravity.  However, they are also attracted to the large
yellow mass.

Remember that the force of gravity is is very strongly dependent on
the distance between the objects.  Since the red mass is closer to the
large yellow mass, it feels a slightly larger gravitational force that
the blue mass feels.

This difference in gravitation forces means that the red mass and the
blue mass would tend to move apart.  As you can see there are two
forces at work on the red and blue masses.  The gravitational force
between them will attract them together, while the differential
gravitational force from the large yellow mass, will separate them.

Which of the two forces will dominate depends on the distance the red
and blue masses are from the large yellow mass.  If the two smaller
masses are far away from the large mass, the attractive force is
dominate.  If the two masses are close to the larger mass the
repulsive force will dominate.  The border between these two cases is
call the <b>Roche Limit</b>

The actual location of the Roche Limit depends on the densities of
masses involved.  For typical objects that we encounter in Astronomy
150, the location of the Roche Limit is approximately 2.5 times the
radius of the central planet.  This is measured from the center of the
central planet, so it is 1.5 radii from the planet's surface.

So what does all of this have to do with rings?  Well, the ring
systems of the giant planets all lie within the Roche limits of the
planets.  The rings are remnants of material of the early solar system
that never formed into satellites because they were within the Roche
limit.  When two object came together, they did not accrete into a
larger body, but moved apart and stayed smaller objects.  A bit of an
oversimplification is: inside Roche limit - Rings, outside Roche limit
- satellites.

<b>An interesting fact:</b> 

On July 7, 1992, the Comet <a
href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/">Shoemaker-Levy 9</a> broke apart
into 21 pieces due to tidal forces when it passed within Jupiter's
Roche Limit; on the subsequent pass, each of the comet's pieces
collided with Jupiter.  The fact that Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke apart
within Jupiter's Roche limit tells us that the mechanical strength of
the comet's nucleus was not very great.  The comet's nucleus was most
likely a <b>rubble pile</b>.  A <b>rubble pile</b> is a weak aggregate
of large and small particles held together by gravity rather than
material strength.
