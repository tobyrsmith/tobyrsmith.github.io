Albedo
</div>


<div id="textbox">


<p>

Albedo is a term we are very familiar with in this class. It it a
measure of the percentage light reflected off the surface of an
object.  We have used this term most frequently when describing the
surfaces of worlds in your solar system.  For example mare surfaces on
the Moon appear dark, we refer to these as low albedo surfaces.  In
contrast the lunar highlands have a relative high albedo.

</p>

<p>

We have even linked the albedo of the lunar surfaces to specific
samples.  For example we have seen that the lunar mare are composed
primarily of basalts.  When viewed by the eye, these basalts look
dark, they have a low albedo, therefor the mare surfaces have a low
albedo.

</div>


<p>

We have indicated albedo by a number ranging between 0.0 and 1.0.  An
albedo of 0.0 is very dark (no light reflected) and an albedo of 1.0
is very bright (all light reflected).  Basalt has an albedo of about
0.11

Color

<p>

When we look at a rock, we are viewing it over the whole of the visible
part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The visible part of the spectrum
is that part of the spectrum that the human eyes respond to.

</p>

<p>

We have all seen that when while light passes through a prism, it is
separated into the various colors that make up the visible spectrum.
Each of these colors correspond to a specific wavelength of light.  In
this class we measure the wavelength of light in nanometers (nm). One nm
is equal to one billionth of a meter.  The human eye is sensitive to
light in the range of 380 to 750 nm.  The image below shows the
correspondence between color and wavelength.

Spectra - Brightness
</div>

<div id="textbox">
<p>

We can be more specific when we measure albedo by also keeping track of
the specific wavelength of light at which me measure the albedo.  When
we do this we can create a plot called a reflectance spectra.  On the
x-axis we plot the wavelength of light, on the y-axis we plot the albedo
at that wavelength.  We will almost always plot the x-axis with blue
(short wavelengths) on the left and red (long wavelengths) on the
right.

<p>

An example: Above are three spectra plots.  The one on the right is a
plot of the reflectance spectra of a sheet of white notebook paper.
As you can see it reflects about 60% (0.6) of the light at all visible
wavelengths.  This is why it appears white.  The middle plot if of a
black piece of paper.  It looks the same, only at a lower albedo 7%
(0.07).  Finally, on the right is a plot of the spectra of a grey
piece of paper.  The albedo of this, 38% (0.38) is in between to white
and black paper.  In general, any object the reflects light of all
wavelengths equally is called a grey object.

</p>

<p>

<i> As you can see the position of the spectra relative to the y-axis is a
measure of the <b>brightness</b> of the object. </i>

<a href="./images/RedSpectra.jpg" class="tooltip" title="Red Ball Spectra">
<img src="./images/RedSpectra_Sm.jpg" /></a>
</div>


<p>

Of course not all objects are grey.  When we say an object is a color
what we are saying is that the object reflects more light in one part
of the spectrum than the others.  For example, the image on the left
shows the spectra of a red ball.  As you can see the spectra is higher
(brighter) at the red part of the spectra.  You can also see that the
ball is fairly bright, the highest albedo is about 60% (0.6).

</p>

<p>

<i>The position of the brightest part of the spectra relative to the
x-axis is a measure of the <b>color</b> of the object.</i>  

</p>

<p>

A reflectance spectra of an object contains information about both the
color <b>and</b> brightness of an object.

<p>

Visible light is only a small fraction of the entire electromagnetic
spectrum.  Everything we have seen above can be generalized to all
wavelengths of light.  For example, we can measure the albedo of a sample
in the infrared part of the spectrum, as well as the visible part.  As a
matter of fact, most of the interesting parts of the spectrum for rocks
are generally in the infrared part of the spectrum.  

</p>

<p>

The spectra on the right shows the reflectance spectra of two rock
samples.  Notice that the visible part of the spectra is only a small
part of the range that is plotted.  You can see that lots of
interesting things are happening outside the visible part of the
spectrum.

</p>

<p>

Remember that you can not see outside of the visible part of the
spectrum, so if I ask you about what something looks like, don't go
drawing stuff out in the infrared or ultraviolet, you can not see out
there.

<div id="SubTitle">
Rocks
</div>

<div id="textbox">
<p>

Rocks are made up of a collection of minerals, and these minerals are
made up of a specific collection and structure of elements (usually in
a crystal structure).  For example, the "Genesis Rock" we talk so much
about that was brought back by Apollo 15 is a type of rock called
an <i>Anorthosite</i>.  This rock is composed primarily of mineral
called <i>plagioclase feldspar</i>.  This mineral has the chemical
formula [CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>] meaning that it
is made up of the elements Calcium (Ca), Aluminum (Al), Silicon (Si),
and Oxygen (O) all arranged in a specific crystal structure.

</p>

<p>

When light is reflected off a rock, the various crystals in the rocks
absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light.  The specific
wavelengths of light they absorb and reflect depends on the
composition and structure of the crystal.  By looking at the
reflectance spectrum of a rock we can get an idea of the minerals that
make up the rock.  This turns out to be a very powerful tool in
planetary astronomy.  It allows us to determine the composition of a
rock by looking at the reflected light.  We do not need the have a
sample in hand.  We do not even have to land on a surface - we can
determine the composition of materials from orbit, or from telescopes
on the Earth.  This type of science-at-a-distance is called <b>remote
sensing</b>.

Filters
</div>

</div>


<p>

While your standard camera will take images using the entire visible
part of the spectrum, most astronomical instruments will image an object
using only a small part of the wavelength range.  Cutting out all but a
small part of the wavelength range is the job of a filter.  Images taken
through filters can be very useful.

</p>

<p>

Look at the spectra on the left.  Both objects have a very similar
spectra in the visible.  A regular camera image of the two objects
would show them to have a very similar color.   

</p>

<p>
 
However, the situation is changed if we look at the objects in the
infrared.  If you had  a filter that only let through the infrared part
of the spectrum (and a detector sensitive to the infrared), you could
easily distinguish the two objects.

</p>

<div id="SubTitle">
An Example - Mars
</div>

<div id="textbox">
<p>

In this class we learned that the 
<a href="http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/home/index.html">Mars Exploration
Rover</a> <b>Opportunity</b> landed at the site that was chosen
because was know to be rich in the mineral <i>hematite</i>.  How was
this site know to have hematite if it had never been visited before?  It was
known through remote sensing.

</p>
<p>

A satellite in orbit around Mars called the
<a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/">Mars Global Surveyor</a>
carried an instrument called
the <a href="http://tes.asu.edu/index.html">Thermal Emission
Spectrometer</a> (TES) that took high resolution spectra of the surface of
Mars in the infrared part of the spectrum, the part were rocks are
interesting.

</p>
<p>

The image below-left shows the infrared spectra of the surface of Mars at
the Opportunity landing site.  The site is mostly composed of basalt
(black spectra).  The red spectra shows the data for hematite.  You
can see that it looks very similar to basalt, except around wavelengths
of 2400 nm (shown at the red bar).  At this wavelength, hematite is
much less reflective than basalt.  By looking only in this part of the
spectra (using a filter) you can pick out the hematite rich regions from
orbit.  This is what the TES on the Mars Global Surveyor did, producing
the map below-center.  The hematite-rich region shows up right in the
middle of the map.  This is where Opportunity was sent (below-right).

</p>

</ul>
</div>


<p>

Of course you can do this for a wide variety of minerals, and indeed
the TES did this producing very
cool <a href="http://jmars.asu.edu/data/">mineral maps</a> of the
surface of Mars.
